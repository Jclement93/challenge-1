# challenge-1

I changed several <div> tags in the HTML to more specific semantic tags to assist with accessibility, and better organize the code for later changes. This allowed me to remove some unnecessary classes from the code as well. 

I added alt text to the images in the content to further boost accessibility. 

I made several changes in the CSS to use more general selectors, making the code more concise where several elements could be styled at once.
